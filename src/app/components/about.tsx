            I am a third-year Computational Mathematics student at the University of Waterloo.
            With a passion for technology and innovation, I am constantly exploring new
            areas in software development and artificial intelligence. 
            I am eager to work in areas that leverage the combined potential of machine learning and
            software development, regardless of traditional boundaries. Outside of academics,
            I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and participating in hackathons.
